# Summary

*Osprey* is a tool for hyperparameter optimization of machine learning
algorithms in Python. Hyperparameter optimization can often be an onerous
process for researchers, due to time-consuming experimental replicates,
non-convex functionals, and constant tension between exploration of global
parameter space and local optimization [@Jones1998]. We've designed *Osprey* to
provide scientists with a practical, easy-to-use way of finding optimal model
parameters. The software works seamlessly with `scikit-learn` estimators
[@scikit-learn] and supports many different search strategies for choosing the
next set of parameters with which to evaluate a given model, including gaussian
processes [@gpy2014], tree-structured Parzen estimators [@hyperopt], as well as
random and grid search. As hyperparameter optimization is an embarrassingly
parallel problem, *Osprey* can easily scale to hundreds of concurrent processes
by executing a simple command-line program multiple times. This makes it easy
to exploit large resources available in high-performance computing environments.

*Osprey* is actively maintained by researchers at Stanford University and other
institutions around the world. While originally developed to analyze
computational protein dynamics [@msmbuilder], it is applicable to any
`scikit-learn`-compatible pipeline. The source code for *Osprey* is hosted on
GitHub and has been archived to Zenodo [@osprey_archive]. Full documentation can
be found at [http://msmbuilder.org/osprey](http://msmbuilder.org/osprey).
