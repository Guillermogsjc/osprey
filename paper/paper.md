# Summary

*Osprey* is a tool for hyperparameter optimization of machine learning
algorithms in Python. Hyperparameter optimization can often be an onerous
process for researchers, due to time-consuming experimental replicates,
non-convex functionals, and constant tension between exploration of global
parameter space and local optimization [@Jones1998]. We've designed *Osprey* to
provide scientists with a practical, easy-to-use way of finding optimal model
parameters. The software works seamlessly with `scikit-learn` estimators and
supports many different search strategies for choosing the next set of
parameters with which to evaluate your model
[@scikit-learn; @gpy2014; @hyperopt]. Its simple command-line interface makes
Osprey instances easy to submit on high-performance computing environments.

*Osprey* is actively being developed by researchers at Stanford University
with primary application areas in computational protein dynamics and drug
design. The source code for *Osprey* is hosted on GitHub and has been archived
to Zenodo [@osprey_archive]. Full documentation can be found at
