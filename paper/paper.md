# Summary

*Osprey* is a tool for hyperparameter optimization of machine learning
algorithms in Python. Hyperparameter optimization can often be an onerous
process for researchers, due to time-consuming experimental replicates,
non-convex objective functions, and constant tension between exploration of
global parameter space and local optimization [@Jones1998]. We've designed
*Osprey* to provide scientists with a practical, easy-to-use way of finding
optimal model parameters. The software works seamlessly with `scikit-learn`
estimators [@scikit-learn] and supports many different search strategies for
choosing the next set of parameters with which to evaluate a given model,
including gaussian processes [@gpy2014], tree-structured Parzen estimators
[@hyperopt], as well as random and grid search. As hyperparameter optimization
is an embarrassingly parallel problem, *Osprey* can easily scale to hundreds of
concurrent processes by executing a simple command-line program multiple times.
This makes it easy to exploit large resources available in high-performance
computing environments.

*Osprey* is actively maintained by researchers at Stanford University and other
institutions around the world. While originally developed to analyze
computational protein dynamics [@msmbuilder], it is applicable to any
`scikit-learn`-compatible pipeline. The source code for *Osprey* is hosted on
GitHub and has been archived to Zenodo [@osprey_archive]. Full documentation can
be found at [http://msmbuilder.org/osprey](http://msmbuilder.org/osprey).
